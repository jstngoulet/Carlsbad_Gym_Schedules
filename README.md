#Carlsbad Gym Schedules
##Created At Calavera Hills Community Center
###Operated by The City of Carlsbad

These gym schedules are created monthly by city staff. While the original draft is formulated by Brian O'Grady, the final revisions and verifications are formlated by J. Goulet. Once an agreement is made on quality and schedule assurance, a draft is sent to Steve Herrera for proofing with his programs. J. Goulet then sends it to be publised to the Recreation Website.
